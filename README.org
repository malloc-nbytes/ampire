** Known Bugs

- Frantically resizing the window will cause a segmentation fault.
- Music titles that are very long will mess up the UI.
- It is unable to display non-utf8 characters.
- Occasional clicking could happen when starting a song, but it goes away after a few seconds.
- Sometimes when you delete a playlist after adding a bunch of them, it will remove the wrong one
  (unsure of the cause as of now).
